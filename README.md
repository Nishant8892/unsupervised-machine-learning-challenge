Part 4: Make a Recommendation
Myopia Clusters Findings
After Preparing the Data, Applying Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and reducing this further with t-SNE I performed a Cluster Analysis with K-Means model. I found**:

The optimal number of clusters seems to be 3

t-SNE was not helpful in finding clusters, there was some some difference after adjusting perplexity but this could be due to random noise.

Some patterns after performing the K-Means clustering but the dataset is too small to make an accurate prediction or for further splitting and training of data.

My recommendation is to get a bigger dataset and to split the data into Test and Training to test the above models and others to be able to make more accurate predictions and clustering.
